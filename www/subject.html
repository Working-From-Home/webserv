        <p class="text-emphase text-center">Summary: This project is here to make you write your HTTP server.
            You will be able to test it with a real browser. HTTP is one of the most used protocols on the internet.
            Knowing its arcane will be useful, even if you won’t be working on a website.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <hr class="hr-invisible">
            <p class="text-justify">The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, 
                collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the 
                World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily 
                access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser. HTTP was developed to 
                facilitate hypertext and the World Wide Web.</p>
            
            <p class="text-justify">The primary function of a web server is to store, process, and deliver web pages to 
                clients. The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
                (HTTP). Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images, style sheets, and 
                scripts in addition to the text content. </p>
            
            <p class="text-justify">Multiple web servers may be used for a high-traffic website.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by 
                requesting a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or 
                an error message if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server’s secondary 
                storage, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the webserver is implemented.</p>
            
            <p class="text-justify">While the primary function is to serve content, full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving 
                content from clients. This feature is used for submitting web forms, including the uploading of files.</p>

                <li>If you need more C functions, you can use them but always prefer C++.</li>

                <li>We will consider that Nginx is HTTP 1.1 compliant and may be used to compare headers and answer behaviors.</li>
                <li>In the subject and the scale we will mention poll but you can use equivalent like select, kqueue, epoll.</li>
                <li>It must be non-blocking and use only 1 poll (or equivalent) for all the IO between the client and the server (listens includes).</li>
                <li>poll (or equivalent) should check read and write at the same time.</li>
                <li>Your server should never block and the client should be bounce properly if necessary.</li>

                <li>A request to your server should never hang forever.</li>
                <li>You server should have default error pages if none are provided.</li>

                <li>You can’t use fork for something else than CGI (like php or python etc...)</li>
                <li>You can’t execve another webserver...</li>
                <li>Your program should have a config file in argument or use a default path.</li>
                <li>You don’t need to use poll (or equivalent) before reading your config file.</li>

                    functions without polling (or equivalent) and your server would be not blocking. But we don’t want that. 
                    Again trying to read/recv or write/send in any FD without going through a poll (or equivalent) will give 
                    you a mark equal to 0 and the end of the evaluation.</div>

                                        <li>Because you won’t call the CGI directly use the full path as PATH_INFO</li>
                                        <li>Just remembers that for chunked request, your server needs to unchunked it and the CGI will expect EOF as end of the body</li>

                                        <li>Your program should call the cgi with the file requested as first argument</li>
